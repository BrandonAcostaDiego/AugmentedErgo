# Mouse Movement Analyzer

## Overview
A Python-based tool designed to help gamers optimize their training sessions by tracking and analyzing mouse movement patterns. This application monitors user inputs, helping users identify patterns to improve efficiency.

## Key Features
- Real-time mouse input tracking (in progress)
- Session-based data collection and analysis (planned)
- Interactive user interface for session management (planned)
- Data visualization of movement patterns and statistics (planned)
- Automated fatigue detection and break recommendations (Planned)

## Technical Architecture
- Mouse movement tracking using Python's pynput library
- Data storage and analysis with Pandas
- GUI implementation with Tkinter
- Future ML/AI integration for pattern recognition


## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1 - Core Functionality
- Mouse tracking (~early Jan)
- Basic data collection (~Jan)
- Simple user interface (~Jan)

### Phase 2 - Data Analysis (~Feb)
- Statistical analysis of movement patterns
- Historical data visualization
- Session comparison tools

### Phase 3 - AI Integration (~March)
- Movement pattern recognition
- Fatigue detection algorithms
- Automated break recommendations
