# Mouse Movement Analyzer

## Overview
A Python-based tool designed to help gamers optimize their training sessions by tracking and analyzing mouse movement patterns. This application monitors user fatigue through mouse movement data collection, helping users identify optimal training periods and prevent performance degradation.

## Key Features
- Real-time mouse movement tracking and distance calculation
- Session-based data collection and analysis
- Interactive user interface for session management
- Data visualization of movement patterns and statistics
- Automated fatigue detection and break recommendations (Planned)

## Technical Architecture
- Mouse movement tracking using Python's pynput library
- Data storage and analysis with Pandas
- GUI implementation with Tkinter
- Future ML/AI integration for pattern recognition


## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1 - Core Functionality
- Mouse movement tracking
- Basic data collection
- Simple user interface

### Phase 2 - Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis of movement patterns
- Historical data visualization
- Session comparison tools

### Phase 3 - AI Integration
- Movement pattern recognition
- Fatigue detection algorithms
- Automated break recommendations
